# Movies-ETL

---
## Overview:
---
  Amazing Prime Video, a platform for streaming movies and tv shows on Amazing Prime, tasked us with creating an automated Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline that will create a Movie Database from a variety of movie data stored across different files. From these files we; created Python Programming that extracted Wikipedia JSON data, Kaggle Metadata, and the MovieLens Rating data, transformed the data with Regular Expressions (Regexs) and defined Functions, and finally loaded the data into a PostgreSQL Movie Database.
